# Thousand-Schnapsen---AI-project

Game in terminal with basic AI in polish language version. 

To launch the program, you can give 4 arguments:

1. Random seed
2. Player key for the first player
3. Player key for the second player
4. Player key for the third player

Where player key is equal to:

1 - if the player is a bot which plays randomly
2 - if the player is a person
3 - if the player is a bot (smarter than bot which plays randomly)

If arguments are not given, the game starts between bot, person and second type bot.
